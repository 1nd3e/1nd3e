# Vladislav Len — @weakvar

Hi, I'm Vlad — an iOS developer from Saint Petersburg. I design and develop apps for iOS since late 2018.

### My projects on the App Store

* [Bubbless](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1510547305) — a simple and quite addictive puzzle.
* [Newton Trails](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1488769404) — platformer.
* [Pongmates](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1461716135) — ping-pong for 2 players.

### What I'm working on

I'm currently working on a personal project — an app that helps people to deal with panic disorder.
